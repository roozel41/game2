=How to make your entities do stuff?=

Actually - you don't want them to do just any stuff. You want them to do your bidding - meaning you want to *control* them.

And that's what the [ControllersViewReference controllers view] is all about.

It allows you to register `EntityControllers` for your entities that will take care of guiding their steps during the game.

Suffice to say, you have to extend the `EntityController` class, [ControllersViewReference#Controllers_factory register it] with the `ControllersView` instance, and off you go.

[FSM Finite state machines] give you more flexibility in terms of how you control an agent in particular situation.
If you want to create more sophisticated AI - I suggest yoou get familiar with it.
