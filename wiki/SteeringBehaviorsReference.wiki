=Steering behaviors=

Steering behaviors allow you to refine your control over an agent by making it move in a semi-physical way and giving an impresion of a fairly advanced movement scheme.


==Introduction==

You can use them by creating an instance of `SteeringBehavior` class, and passing it a *movable* entity.

A movable entity is an entity with a `DynamicObject` aspect set ( take a look [here] to see how it's done ).

If the entity doesn't have that aspect, it will stay imprevious to any movement commands.

*CAUTION* :The behavior instance needs to be *updated* each tick.

==Behaviors list==
  * seek
{{{
/**
 * Makes the entity rush towards the specified goal position.
 * 
 * @param goal
 * @return instance to self, allowing to chain commands
 */
public SteeringBehaviors seek( Vector3 goal )
}}}

  * wander ( there are 2 versions of this behavior )
{{{
/**
 * Makes the entity wander around aimlessly.
 * 
 * @return instance to self, allowing to chain commands
 */
public SteeringBehaviors wander();

/**
 * Makes the entity wander around aimlessly.
 * 
 * @param initialDir		initial movement direction
 * @return instance to self, allowing to chain commands
 */
public SteeringBehaviors wander( Vector3 initialDir );
}}}

  * faceMovementDirection

{{{
/**
 * Makes the entity face its movement direction ( direction of the velocity vector )
 * 
 * @return instance to self, allowing to chain commands
 */
public SteeringBehaviors faceMovementDirection();
}}}

  * lookAt
{{{
/**
 * Makes the entity rotate so that it's looking down the specified vector.
 * 
 * @param lookAtVec
 * @return instance to self, allowing to chain commands
 */
public SteeringBehaviors lookAt( Vector3 lookAtVec );
}}}

==Language==
The class was constructed in a way that allows you to define movement behaviors using a *dot-language* syntax:

{{{
// behavior that will make an agent wander aimlessly, always trying to face its movement direction
m_sb.begin()
   .wander()
   .faceMovementDirection();

// behavior that will make an agent run towards the specified position, always looking in the specified direction
m_sb.begin()
   .seek( m_goToPos )
   .lookAt( lookingDirection );
}}}
