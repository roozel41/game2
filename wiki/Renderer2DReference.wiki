= Renderer 2D =

The renderer gives you ability to draw 2D sprites on the screen.

The drawn screen can be a lot larger than the screen. The visible portion of the screen is defined using a camera.


== Sprites ==
Sprites are 2D bitmaps.

Due to an optimization issues, all sprites we want to render are located in an *atlas* texture.

Sprites are drawn using the texture regions, which specify the portion of the atlas bitmap ( in pixels ) the sprite is located in.


== Atlas ==
An atlas is a large texture where an artist can place a lot of smaller sprite bitmaps.
