= Renderer 2D =

The renderer gives you ability to draw 2D sprites on the screen.

The drawn screen can be a lot larger than the screen. The visible portion of the screen is defined using a camera.


== Sprites ==
Sprites are 2D bitmaps.

Due to an optimization issues, all sprites we want to render are located in an *atlas* texture.

Sprites are drawn using the texture regions, which specify the portion of the atlas bitmap ( in pixels ) the sprite is located in.


== Atlas ==
An atlas is a large texture where an artist can place a lot of smaller sprite bitmaps.

*CAUTION* an atlas texture has to have a ^2 ( power of two ) dimensions, and the largest supported dimensions are 1024x1024.

== Animation ==
*TODO*

== Sprite batcher ==
A device used to draw sprites on the screen.
It uses two methods:

{{{
/**
 * Draws a sprite with the texture defined for the batch.
 * 
 * @param x				sprite center X coordinate
 * @param y				sprite center Y coordinate
 * @param width			desired sprite width
 * @param height		desired sprite height
 * @param region		texture region to draw the sprite with
 */
public void drawSprite( float x, float y, float width, float height, TextureRegion region );

/**
 * Draws a rotated sprite with the texture defined for the batch.
 * 
 * @param x				sprite center X coordinate
 * @param y				sprite center Y coordinate
 * @param width			desired sprite width
 * @param height		desired sprite height
 * @param angle			rotation angle in degrees
 * @param region		texture region to draw the sprite with
 */
public void drawSprite( float x, float y, float width, float height, float angle, TextureRegion region );

}}}

The latter allows to draw rotated sprites.
Both allow to specify the size of the sprite, so we can scale the images to our hearts contents.

== Entity visual ==

Entity's visual aspects are represented using an EntityVisual abstract class.
The class contains a method:

{{{
/**
 * Draw self.
 * 
 * @param batcher
 */
public abstract void draw( SpriteBatcher batcher );
}}}

Override this method in your custom implementation to get access to the SpriteBatcher instance which you can use to render your objects.

The class should contain the description of TextureRegions or Animations from the shared atlas that describe where the desired sprite is.


*CAUTION*: The renderer currently uses just a single atlas texture, so you can't specify which texture to select.
