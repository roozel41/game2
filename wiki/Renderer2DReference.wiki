= Renderer 2D =

The renderer gives you ability to draw 2D sprites on the screen.

The drawn screen can be a lot larger than the screen. The visible portion of the screen is defined using a camera.


== Sprites ==
Sprites are 2D bitmaps.

Due to an optimization issues, all sprites we want to render are located in an *atlas* texture.

Sprites are drawn using the texture regions, which specify the portion of the atlas bitmap ( in pixels ) the sprite is located in.


== Atlas ==
An atlas is a large texture where an artist can place a lot of smaller sprite bitmaps.

== Sprite batcher ==
A device used to draw sprites on the screen.
It uses two methods:

{{{
/**
 * Draws a sprite with the texture defined for the batch.
 * 
 * @param x				sprite center X coordinate
 * @param y				sprite center Y coordinate
 * @param width			desired sprite width
 * @param height		desired sprite height
 * @param region		texture region to draw the sprite with
 */
public void drawSprite( float x, float y, float width, float height, TextureRegion region );

/**
 * Draws a rotated sprite with the texture defined for the batch.
 * 
 * @param x				sprite center X coordinate
 * @param y				sprite center Y coordinate
 * @param width			desired sprite width
 * @param height		desired sprite height
 * @param angle			rotation angle in degrees
 * @param region		texture region to draw the sprite with
 */
public void drawSprite( float x, float y, float width, float height, float angle, TextureRegion region );

}}}

The latter allows to draw rotated sprites.
Both allow to specify the size of the sprite, so we can scale the images to our hearts contents.
