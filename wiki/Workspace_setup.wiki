=All you need to get coding=

1. Download the latest Eclipse

2. Download the latest Java JDK

3. Setup an environment variable JDK_HOME to point to your JDK install directory

4. Download Android SDK (if it asks you to install a Java JDK, simply press the 'Back' button and proceed again )

5. Startup Eclipse, and from menu Help / Install New Software select 'All Available Sites' and search for a project called 'Subversive' - install it

6. Once all that is done, download the code and get jiggy with it ;)
