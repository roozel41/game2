=All you need to get coding=

==Required SDKs & Eclipse==

1. Download the latest Eclipse

2. Download the latest [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk-7u1-download-513651.html Java JDK]

3. Setup an environment variable JDK_HOME to point to your JDK install directory

4. Download and install [http://dl.google.com/android/installer_r15-windows.exe Android SDK] (if it asks you to install a Java JDK, simply press the 'Back' button and proceed again )

5. Startup your Eclipse - setup your workspace directory etc. Keep in mind that this will be the directory where all your project files will be stored, so choose wisely so you can find it afterwards in case of an Eclipse failure ;)

==ADT Eclipse plugins==

6. Open menu *Help* / *Install New Software*.

7. Paste this address: `https://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipse` into the field visible on the screen and select all found options:

8. Press *Next>* and proceed with accepting all agreements and whatnot the installer's gonna present you with.

9. Restart Eclipse.

==Subversive Eclipse plugins==

10. Again, open menu *Help* / *Install New Software*.

11. Here, the address for the site's gonna differ from one Eclipse version to another. Basically what you need to do is expand the *Work with* dropdown list - there you'll have a few links listed, and one of them's gonna be named just as your Eclipse version.
The version I'm using at the time of writing this manual is called *Idigo*, so just follow the pattern.

12. Type in`subversive` into the *filter* text area. You should see something similar to this:

13. Once again select all listed packages with a name that contains *subversive*, and press *Next>*

14. Restart Eclipse.

15. At this point you'll be asked to select an *SVN Connector*. Select *SVNKit 1.3.5* or something similar.

==Workspace download==

OK - now you have IDE fully configured and ready to work. Time to download the code.

Depending on what project you'll be working on, you're gonna need:
  * the engine
  * the project

 
1. Start Eclipse

2. Right-click anywhere in the *Package Explorer* area:

[http://khaky-birds.eclipselabs.org.codespot.com/files/projects_download.jpg]

3. In the dropdown menu, select *Import*, and in the dialog window select *SVN/Project from SVN* option and press *Next>*.

[http://khaky-birds.eclipselabs.org.codespot.com/files/import_SVN.jpg]

4. The next dialog *Checkout from SVN* presents a list of preconfigured SVN locations. Your list should be empty at this point. Check the *Create a new repository location* and press *Next>*

5. Paste the information about the repository:

[http://khaky-birds.eclipselabs.org.codespot.com/files/checkout_from_svn.jpg]

You need to input your user name and password. The user name is the name of your *gmail* account up until the *@* character - i.e. my account address is *ptrochim@gmail.com*, so my user name is *ptrochim*.

The password is generated for each user on the project webpage. Here's where you can find it:

6. Press *Next>*, and another dialog will appear. It will ask you to select the project you want to checkout from the repository.

Select the engine project:

[http://khaky-birds.eclipselabs.org.codespot.com/files/checking_out_the_engine.jpg]

And press *Finish* - Eclipse will download the engine code for you.

7. Now, we need to download the project. For the time being let's assume you're working on the *Khaky Birds*. What you need to do is repeat the steps from 1 to 3, and in point 4 instead of selecting *Create a new repository location*, select *Use existing repository location* and select it from the list.

8. Now - repeat step 6, but select a different project:

[http://khaky-birds.eclipselabs.org.codespot.com/files/checking_out_the_game.jpg]

And press *Finish* - Eclipse will download the game code for you.



*Enjoy*
